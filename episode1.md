# One rainy moment

I can't reveal her name.

It was a rainy day and I was sitting on a bench.
It was drizzling..
The time was around 1pm but it felt like 4 in the evening.
Dark Clouds spread across the entire sky.

I had my umbrella
There was an empty road infront of me.
I was wishing time would stop.
But it never seemed to listen to me.

I had had dreams of her as a child.
She was exactly like I had imagined

There was nobody around us.
I asked her where she was all this time.
She said I didn't call her , so she didn't come.

I didn't want to argue any more.
We had complicated things between us.
Turns out they were actually very simple.

She touched me on the head,
and said everything will be fine.
And then it did.
But only temporarily

She said she had to leave,
I held her hand, but I realized ...
She had already gone.

Many have searched for her.
But they always forget to look inside themselves.
