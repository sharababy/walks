# She visited again

I was on my way to the gift shop.  
Thats where I work.  

The time was 6:30 in the morning.
It had just stopped raining.
The sky showed no sign of the sun
The old streetlamps were still glowing.

The street was empty.
The pavement was wet.
Small shops tightly packed next to each other
flowed till the end of the road.

There was a vivid silence in the air.
It felt familiar,

I stopped walking.

I looked aross from my shoulder,
and there she was.

I turned and kept looking at her for a few minutes,
until it started drizzling again.

She started waliking towards me.
I stood still , trying not to do something stupid.

She stood infront of me , seemingly real.

I forgot all the regrets
all the sorrow,
all the agony,
all my worries.

All of it seemed trivial.

My existance was pain.
Her's was bliss

She was immortal , I wasn't
She was pure , I wasn't
...
She was smiling , I wasn't

Yet still , there she was , holding my hand.
And I was the one , who let go of hers.

I knew I wasn't worthy of her love,
and neither were my tears.

Her eyes said goodbye , and before I blinked 
She was gone.

Everthing came back,

I looked at the time.
It was still 6:30am

Maybe Time had listened this time ,maybe

..
I continued to the gift shop.
